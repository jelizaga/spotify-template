# spotify-template
This template is an optional starting point for a challenge for the following [course](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/) at the University of Washington.  The instructions are described [here](http://faculty.washington.edu/mikefree/info343/#/challenges/spotify).

##### What is the purpose of your project (i.e., why would someone use this app)? #####
> It's mostly something to put in my portfolio that looks nice, at the moment. Maybe in a later commit I'll add some extra functionality with Parse.
##### What is the URL of this project on your student web-server? #####
> http://students.washington.edu/jelizaga/info343/spotify-template/
##### Did you receive help from any other sources (classmates, etc.)? If so, please list who. #####
> Referenced Spotify's endpoint documentation. Google's angular.js documentation is so dense that it'd probably take me a month to wade through it; the W3 angular documentation is much more digestible.
##### Approximately how many hours did it take you to complete this challenge? #####
> 12-14, probably.
##### Did you encounter any problems in this challenge we should warn students about in the future? How can we make the challenge better? #####
> It's a fun challenge and I wish I had more time to work on it. I found that bootstrap's form class has certain strict css styles that I can't modify; for example, I spent a long while in Firebug trying to get the input element to center, only to read in a W3 or stackoverflow post that this was impossible. I wish I could color the button differently, change its font and center that too.
